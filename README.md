# Data-Management-Repo
Assignment: GitHub Repository 

This Github Repository is for an assignment for the module Data Management, run by Jasper Slingsby.
You will find a CSV file on data on species richness and total abundance of various invertebrates against different macrophyte types, collected from Western Australia. 
In addition to the CSV, there is a folder called 'scripts', where all of my coding is stored. 
In the scripts folder, my code is stored on 'analysis.r' and my markdown is called 'analysis.quarto.qmd'.
The rest of the items in the 'scripts' folder are plots created from my code. 
I will not need any licenses as I collected and counted this data myself.
